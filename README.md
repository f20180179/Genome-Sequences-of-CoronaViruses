# Genome-Sequences-of-CoronaViruses

Here similarities of Covid-19 coronavirus with previously discovered coronavirus is shown.
Oligonucleotide composition is the criteria that is used.
In computational terms, oligonucleotide is are words of k size. Here k=3 is used i.e trinucleotides.
Total number of distinct trinucleotide is 4^3 /2 because canonical forms of a codon is not considered seperately.

The genome sequence is analyzed to find the count of these 32 codons in SARS-CoV-2(Covid-19), SARS-CoV, and bat-like-SARS.
Python's matplot library and numpy libraries are used to find their count and plotted. 
By the graph we see similarities of SARS-CoV-2 with bat-like-SARS and their GC count are also closely related.
